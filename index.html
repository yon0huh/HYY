    <p>My friend drew a picture for me.</p>
    <p>I am a student majoring in computer engineering at Kangwon National University.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become an artificial intelligence expert.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Seoul.</p>          
    <p>I have mom, dad, and older brother.</p>     
    <p>I can live well without feeling stuffy even if I don't go out of the house often.</p> 
    <p>I didn't have any projects or other portfolios, so I wrote a lot of trivial stories.</p>

        <p>My hobby is watching the same movie several times. I don't have many favorite movie genres, so I watch interesting movies over and over again. I usually watch Disney animation or comedy movies. It's good to be able to focus on other things every time I watch a movie. If I watch the same movie several times, I can understand the movie better, and I can see the small details that I didn't see at first. For example, Olaf was so cute in Frozen 2 that I watched movies more than five times in the movie theater. I haven't seen many movies lately because I haven't been to the movie theater often, but I've seen the movie 'Soul' three times. If I watch a movie once and think it's fun, I watch it at least twice in the theater. I also make photo tickets for movies that I watched as a secondary hobby.</p>

                        <p>It's a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, but there are some funny parts. I recommend this movie to everyone around me.</p>

                        <p>I like musical movies, and this movie is memorable because I watched it in Korea and watched it at a movie theater in Japan a few years ago when I went to Japan with my friend.</p>

                        <p>It's a movie that makes me think a lot. The material was unique and the color of the movie was very good.</p>
